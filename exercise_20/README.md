# Exercise 20

## Task

Compose a table with the following fields:

* Name of an acquiring company
* Amount of an acquisition
* Name of an acquired company
* Investment amount put into an acquired company
* Share that reflects by how much the amount of an acquisition surpassed the investment amount (rounded up to integer)

Do not include acquisitions where the buy amount is zero. If the investment in the company is zero, exclude such a company from a table.
